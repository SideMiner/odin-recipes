   <h2>Description</h2>
   <h3>Boiled eggs are eggs, typically from a chicken, cooked with their 
    shells unbroken, usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled 
    eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify, 
    while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk, and sometimes the white, 
    at least partially liquid and raw</h3>
